### **Ingredients:**
- **Whole chicken:** 1 (3–4 lbs), boiled and deboned
- **Bell peppers:** Up to 2 large, finely chopped
- **Onion:** 1 large, finely chopped
- **Celery:** 3–4 stalks, chopped
- **Smoked sausage:** 2 lbs, sliced
- **Garlic:** 1 head, minced
- **Mixed vegetables:** 12–24 oz (optional)
- **Cajun seasoning:** 1.5 tablespoons
- **Black pepper:** 1 teaspoon
- **Paprika:** 1 teaspoon
- **Dried thyme:** 1 teaspoon
- **Salt:** 1.5 teaspoons
- **Oil:** 1 cup
- **Flour:** 1 cup
- **Okra:** 12–24 oz, sliced (optional)

### **Instructions:**

1. **Prepare Chicken and Stock:**
   - Boil the whole chicken to make a rich stock.
   - Debone the chicken and put the meat back into the pot.
   - Keep the stock warm.

2. **Brown Sausage and Sauté Vegetables:**
   - In a large pan, heat some oil over medium-high heat.
   - Add sliced sausage and brown on all sides.
   - Add onions, bell peppers, minced garlic, and mixed vegetables.
   - Sauté until vegetables are softened. The moisture from the vegetables will naturally deglaze the pan.
   - **Note:** Avoid overcrowding the pan to ensure proper browning.
   - Add the sausage and vegetables to the pot.

3. **Make the Roux:**
   - In the same pan, add **1 cup of oil**.
   - Gradually add **1 cup of flour**, stirring continuously.
   - Cook, stirring constantly, until the roux is dark brown (about 20–30 minutes).

4. **Combine Roux and Stock:**
   - Add the roux directly into the pot with the warm chicken stock.
   - Stir well to combine.

5. **Add Seasonings and Celery:**
   - Add the following to the pot:
     - **1.5 tablespoons Cajun seasoning**
     - **1 teaspoon black pepper**
     - **1 teaspoon paprika**
     - **1 teaspoon dried thyme**
     - **1.5 teaspoons salt**
   - Add chopped celery.
   - Stir thoroughly to incorporate all seasonings.

6. **Add Okra (Optional):**
   - If using, add sliced okra to the pot.

7. **Simmer:**
   - Bring the gumbo to a gentle simmer.
   - Cook for 1–2 hours, stirring occasionally.
   - Skim off any excess oil from the surface if necessary.

### **Serving Suggestion:**
- Serve hot over cooked white rice.
- Offer hot sauce on the side.

### **Notes:**
- **Vegetable Moisture:** The moisture from the vegetables is sufficient to deglaze the pan; additional stock shouldn't be needed but can be used if necessary.
- **Roux:** Stir constantly to prevent burning.
- **Browning:** Avoid overcrowding the pan for optimal caramelization.
