## Ingredients:

- Whole chicken: 1 (3-4 lbs)
- Bell pepper: 1 large, finely chopped (about 2 cups)
- Onion: 1 large, finely chopped (about 2 cups)
- Celery: 3-4 stalks, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
- Smoked sausage: 2 lb, sliced
- Cajun seasoning: 1 tablespoon
- Salt: 1 teaspoon
- Oil: 1 cup
- Flour: 1 cup
- Okra: 2 cups, sliced (optional)

## Instructions:

1. Start by making stock from the whole chicken and boiling it down to a rich broth.
2. Debone the cooked chicken and add it back into the pot.
3. Add the trinity (bell pepper, onion, and celery) to the pot and cook until they're broken down.
4. Add smoked sausage to the pot.
5. Season with Cajun seasoning and salt.
6. Make a roux by heating oil in a pan over medium heat. Gradually add flour, stirring continuously, until the mixture reaches a shade darker than peanut butter or a few shades lighter than Nutella (approximately 45 minutes).
7. Add the roux to the gumbo pot and stir well.
8. Continue cooking for another couple of hours, adding okra 30 minutes before serving if desired.

### Note:
Be careful not to burn the roux during the cooking process! Continuous stirring is necessary to achieve the right color and flavor.
