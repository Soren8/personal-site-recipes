### **Ingredients:**
- **Whole chicken:** 1 (3-4 lbs), boiled and deboned
- **Bell pepper:** 1 large, finely chopped (2 cups)
- **Onion:** 1 large, finely chopped (2 cups)
- **Celery:** 3-4 stalks, finely chopped (1 cup)
- **Smoked sausage:** 2 lbs, sliced
- **Garlic:** 1 head, minced
- **Cajun seasoning:** 1.5 tbsp
- **Black pepper:** 1 tsp
- **Paprika:** 1 tsp
- **Dried thyme:** 1 tsp
- **Salt:** 1.5 tsp
- **Oil:** 1 cup
- **Flour:** 1 cup
- **Okra:** 2 cups, sliced (optional)

### **Instructions:**

1. **Prepare Stock and Chicken:**
   - Boil the whole chicken to make a rich stock.
   - Debone the chicken and set the meat aside. Keep the stock warm.

2. **Brown Sausage and Vegetables:**
   - Brown the sliced sausage and sauté bell pepper, onion, celery, and minced garlic in a large pot with oil.
   - **Note:** Avoid overcrowding the pot to ensure proper browning.

3. **Deglaze the Pot:**
   - Add ½ cup warm chicken stock and scrape up browned bits. Simmer for 1 minute.

4. **Make the Roux:**
   - Add remaining oil and flour to the pot.
   - Cook, stirring constantly, until the roux is dark brown (about 20-30 minutes).

5. **Combine with Stock:**
   - Gradually add the rest of the warm stock to the roux, stirring continuously to prevent lumps.

6. **Add Meats and Seasonings:**
   - Return the deboned chicken and browned sausage to the pot.
   - Stir in Cajun seasoning, black pepper, paprika, dried thyme, and salt.

7. **Add Okra (Optional):**
   - Add sliced okra for natural thickening and extra flavor.

8. **Simmer:**
   - Let the gumbo simmer gently for 1-2 hours, stirring occasionally and skimming off excess oil.

9. **Final Adjustments:**
   - Adjust seasoning with more Cajun seasoning or salt if needed.
   - Modify consistency by adding more stock or simmering longer.

10. **Serve:**
    - Serve hot over cooked white rice.
    - Garnish with chopped green onions or parsley if desired. Offer hot sauce on the side.

### **Tips:**
- **Roux:** Stir constantly to prevent burning.
- **Browning:** Avoid overcrowding the pot for optimal caramelization.
- **Consistency:** Maintain a gentle simmer to keep the sauce stable.
