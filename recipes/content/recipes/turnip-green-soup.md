Ingredients:
  - 1 tbsp olive oil or butter
  - 1/2 lb Conecuh Original smoked sausage, diced (use more if you like)
  - 1 onion, chopped (3/4 cup)
  - 1 large (27 oz) can seasoned turnip greens*, undrained
  - 2 (16 oz) cans reduced-sodium chicken broth
  - 1 (10 oz) can Rotel tomatoes with green chilies, undrained
  - 1 (14.5 oz) can Hunt's petite-diced tomatoes, undrained
  - 1 (16 oz) can navy beans, rinsed and drained
  - 1 (15 1/2 oz) can black-eyed peas, rinsed and drained
  - 1 (15 oz) can pinto or kidney beans, rinsed and drained (I used pintos)
  - 1/8 - 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt, or to taste
  - 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon Creole seasoning, or to taste (such as Tony Chachere's)

Instructions:
  - Chop, slice, dice, or drain everything first.

  - Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; add the diced sausage and onion and saut√© until the sausage is lightly browned. Drain if desired. Add the remaining ingredients to the pot, stirring gently just to combine.

  - Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for about 30 minutes, adding more chicken broth or tomato juice if needed for desired consistency.

  - ((NOTE: The recipe as written is somewhat spicy, so feel free to adjust seasonings according to your tastes. The beans listed are the ones I used, but use whatever kind you like, more or less.))
